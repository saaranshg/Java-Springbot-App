# Quick JAR Upload via GitHub Web Interface

## üöÄ Upload JAR File to GitHub (No Git Required)

### Step 1: Prepare the JAR File
Your JAR file is located at: `S:\Java Springbot App\target\sql-solver-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
Size: 50.8 MB (53,084,469 bytes)

### Step 2: Upload via GitHub Web Interface
1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/saaranshg/Java-Springbot-App
2. **Navigate to target folder**: 
   - If `target/` folder doesn't exist, click **"Create new file"**
   - Type `target/README.md` to create the folder
   - Add any content and commit
3. **Upload JAR file**:
   - Go into the `target/` folder
   - Click **"Add file"** ‚Üí **"Upload files"**
   - Drag and drop: `sql-solver-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
   - Commit message: "Add compiled Spring Boot JAR file"
   - Click **"Commit changes"**

### Step 3: Verify Upload
Check that your JAR is at: https://github.com/saaranshg/Java-Springbot-App/blob/main/target/sql-solver-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

### Step 4: Test Download Link
Your download link will be: https://github.com/saaranshg/Java-Springbot-App/raw/main/target/sql-solver-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- GitHub has a 100MB file size limit (your file is 50.8MB, so it's fine)
- Make sure the repository is **public** for raw links to work
- The upload might take a few minutes due to file size

## Alternative: GitHub Desktop
1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Clone your repository
3. Copy the JAR file to the target folder
4. Commit and push through GitHub Desktop

## Quick Commands (After Git Installation)
```powershell
# If you install Git later, use these commands:
cd "S:\Java Springbot App"
git clone https://github.com/saaranshg/Java-Springbot-App.git temp
copy target\sql-solver-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar temp\target\
cd temp
git add target\sql-solver-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
git commit -m "Add compiled JAR file"
git push origin main
```
